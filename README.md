Extension Bookmarker
====================

Overview
--------

Extension Bookmarker is a Visual Studio Code (VSC) extension that allows you to bookmark other extensions. This makes it easy to keep track of your favorite or frequently used extensions, as well as those you are interested in but perhaps not ready to install yet.

Screenshots and Demo

- Coming Soon!

**Note**: When adding or removing bookmarks, make sure to copy the identifier exactly as shown, including the publisher and extension name (publisher.extensionname).

How to locate and copy an extension's identifier within the VSC Extensions Marketplace:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Open the Extensions view in VSC by clicking on the "Extensions" icon in the Activity Bar on the side or by using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac).
2. In the search bar at the top, enter the name or keywords related to the extension you are looking for.
3. From the search results, locate the extension you are interested in, right click on it and select "Copy Extension ID". The extension's identifier is now copied.
3. Alternatively, from the search results, locate the extension you are interested in and click on it to open its details page.
4. On the details page, you will find the extension's identifier listed under the extension's "More Info" section. Select the identifier and press `Ctrl+C`. The extension's identifier is now copied.
